# ZDI_flares
Amassing flare rates for ZDI sample

Working with @jspineda on gathering what is known about stellar magnetism from the incredible ZDI literature, and adding flare activity to the picture.

Goals:
- gather all data to enable making the M dwarf "confusogram"
- get all available flare rates for these stars
- plan for TESS to fill out the flare sample!
